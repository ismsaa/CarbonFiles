## What is it?

A program which will replace and improve upon Windows File Explorer. Possible version for iOS/iPadOS as well because I use those and the Files app sucks. Less likely, but maybe versions for MacOS, Android, and Linux. Those three are less likely because I don't use them and I don't have any devices with those Operating Systems in order to test those applications. However, this program will be Open Source and if others wish to create ports/forks, they absolutely can.

## Features

### Planned:
- All the features Windows File Explorer provides
- Faster load times than Windows File Explorer. Way faster. like [VoidTools Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) fast.
- By default, more pretty than Windows File Explorer, and has many customizable features. Like Themes/colors, presets and also individual color, style, and UI placement choices.
- More searching capabilities than Windows File Explorer (e.g. by file name, file type, tags *and nested tags* on files, content within files, and within the note/description added to files)
- Adding notes/descriptions to files which are included alongside the file itself. Helps with organization, identification, and time spent finding what you’re really looking for.
- Ability to permanently delete files instead of sending them to the recycle bin.
- Alongside the normal 'Delete file' option, there will be an option to 'uninstall this program' on applications it is able to find an uninstall file for.
- Specially added uninstall code to uninstall notoriously 'hard to get rid' software. *I'm looking at you, McAfee.* **This is a feature which is undecided if it will really exist. I'll decide down the line. May become it’s own project, [[Project Hub#Better Uninstaller (Name WIP)|Better Uninstaller]].**
- **When you download a file, it will attempt to automate adding tags to your files. Trying to make it less of a hassle for the user to organize their files. *This is the big feature, and will be toggleable by the user, with the ability to include or exclude specific folders, drives, or file types.***
	- Using A.I.(?) or some other method to search the content and add tags to the file. Tags created by AI will have special formatting (also customizable) versus tags added by the user.
	- To be clear, no data will be collected by myself. All data remains on the user's own machine.
- *Mostly pertaining to the feature mentioned before this.* To provide a list of file types that exist on the user’s machine, as well as their amount, which may influence a user’s choice on what files to allow/disallow for automated tagging, as well as just more information for the user about their data which is always a plus.
	- Maybe a feature which estimates how long it takes on average to add tags to such file types, but this sounds like a useless feature. Just an idea.
- Making it possible for others to create their own plugins/add-ons for this project.
	- Having plugins be accessible to be downloaded directly from within the program itself, similar to how [Obsidian](https:www.obsidian.md) does it.

### What has been added?

- So far, nothing officially.

## Extra

Development of this project ‘officially’ started on April 19th, 2024.

I am a novice programmer, and this will be my first big project. It is definitely a big goal to achieve, but I think it would an extremely useful program for myself and also for many others.

If you are interested in this project or myself, [this link](https://share.note.sx/6eoub87y#wfAxfTvfvyOwSUxJo33J/Jojunh4U5dmOHsLA8jq+eM) leads to a list of my potential, in-progress, and past projects, as well as tells you some more about myself.
